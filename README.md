The playbook (win-update-all.yml) this playbook will update Windows with all available updates.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Setting up Ansible to talk to Windows is a little different than talking to Linux hosts.
* On the Windows host open a Powershell window enter Get-ExecutionPolicy.
* Change the execution policy from restricted to unrestricted, by default won't be able to execute any scripts.  
* Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted.
* Copy the script located in the Scripts directory ConfigureRemoteForAnsible.ps1 to the Downloads directory.
* Go back to the Powershell Window and run it .\ConfigureRemoteForAnsible.ps1
* The script checks some basic conditions like if the correct version of PowerShell is installed and if WinRM is listening.

Ansible collections install on Linux where Ansible is installed
```
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows
```

### Installing

* Configure your inventory files and variables, unlike managing Linux servers your be connecting over WinRM not SSH.
* group_vars, this is where you place your inventory variables.
* Note group vars is where you can store the Adninstrator password, for prodction evviroments and storing on Git, use ansible vault to store secrets. 

### Executing the playbooks

ansible '*' -m win_ping
ansible-playbook win-update-all.yml -e "admin_password=your_password" (passing in the password with extra vars)
